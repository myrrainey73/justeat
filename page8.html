You never know what is available until you pay and order. Then you get a message that the item isn t available so you will get a refund. 5-10 days later. If you order several items, for example hot some meat, rice, drink and seasoning and after you pay you are informed that everything is out except the seasoning, then they deliver you that one item alone, but still charging the same fees. Disgusting business. 3 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful? <span> </span> <span> Yes</span> <span> </span> <span> No</span> A Google user <i> more_vert</i> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> Flag inappropriate</span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> July 30, 2019</span> This app is a hilarious and a frustrating waste of your time. Sometimes it says lost connection or it asks for payment 3 times even though the confirmation email arrived, it can RARELY find your history, and the latest one is after I went through the confusing and clunky menus and managed to put a new order together only to press on go to checkout and the next screen to appear for less than 2 seconds and bump me back to the go to checkout page. Still doesn t work. Get it together people! 23 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful? <span> </span> <span> Yes</span> <span> </span> <span> No</span> Steve Donaldson <i> more_vert</i> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> Flag inappropriate</span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> December 27, 2023</span> Garbage, has to be updated every time I use it which doesn t work, so has to be uninstalled then reinstalled but still won t work, every time I select an item and it goes to the basket, the next selection will fail and say there was a problem . This then deletes that selection AND the previous one, so the basket is constantly empty and it is literally impossible to order a single item of food. It would be faster and better to write the restaurant a letter, pop cash in the envelope and wait.

You can leave a note with any special delivery instructions for the restaurant at the checkout.<br> <br> We’ve added a handful of behind-the-scenes improvements to your app this month. And, like sweet BBQ sauce on your chicken wings, they ll simply make it better. <i> flag</i> Flag as inappropriate <h2> App support</h2> <i> expand_more</i> <i> public</i> Website <span> </span> <i> email</i> Support email googleplay@just-eat.com <span> </span> <i> shield</i> Privacy Policy <span> </span> <h2> <span> More by Just-Eat Holding Limited</span> </h2> <i> arrow_forward</i> <span> Just Eat ITA Cibo a Domicilio</span> <span> Just-Eat Holding Limited</span> <span> 4.5</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> Just Eat ES Comida a Domicilio</span> <span> Just-Eat Holding Limited</span> <span> 4.3</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> Just Eat Ireland-Food Delivery</span> <span> Just-Eat Holding Limited</span> <span> 4.2</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> Menulog AU | Food Delivery</span> <span> Just-Eat Holding Limited</span> <span> 4.0</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> Menulog | NZ Takeaway Online</span> <span> Just-Eat Holding Limited</span> <span> 4.1</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> JET Events</span> <span> Just-Eat Holding Limited</span> <h2> <span> Similar apps</span> </h2> <i> arrow_forward</i> <span> Deliveroo: Food Delivery UK</span> <span> Deliveroo</span> <span> 4.5</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> DoorDash - Food Delivery</span> <span> DoorDash</span> <span> 4.6</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> Deliveroo Rider</span> <span> Deliveroo</span> <span> 4.1</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> Thuisbezorgd.nl</span> <span> Takeaway.com</span> <span> 4.4</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> Gorillas: Online Food Delivery</span> <span> Gorillas Technologies GmbH</span> <span> 3.5</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <span> Monzo - Mobile Banking</span> <span> Monzo</span> <span> 4.7</span> <span> <i> star</i> </span> <i> flag</i> Flag as inappropriate <span> Google Play</span> <p> Play Pass</p> <p> Play Points</p> <p> Gift cards</p> <p> Redeem</p> <p> Refund policy</p> <span> Kids &amp; family</span> <p> Parent Guide</p> <p> Family sharing</p> <p> Terms of Service</p> <p> Privacy</p> <p> About Google Play</p> <p> Developers</p> <p> Google Store</p> United States (English)<br>
